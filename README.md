# Rolling-dice

It was a simple project for a class which attended on UOM, called "Blockchain tecnologies", 
in which the user puts an ammount for bet, then he bets for a greater ">" or less "<" than 5.

Afterwards if the random number generated every time matches the interval that he choosed he wins. 
If not, it displays the random number and a message with the result.

It's written in pure html&css, and the code runs with Php.
